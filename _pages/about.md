I am a software developer and researcher currently completing my Masters in Computer Science (AI Track) from Binghamton University. My expertise include autonomous navigation systems in drones, computer vision, and machine learning.

I am searching for full-time software development and machine learning engineer positions. If you would like to connect with me, check out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin }}), [Github](https://github.com/zainasir), or [Email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) me.

## Graduate Research
My current research involves optimizing [Edge-SLAM](https://github.com/droneslab/edgeslam) and tailoring it for deployment on small drones with limited computation power. Since January 2013, I have developed a robust data pipeline that transmits live video feed from drones to a SLAM system for feature detection and map construction. My system is also compatible with Docker for efficient deployment and portability.

Looking forward, my goal is to incorporate network analysis as part of my master's thesis. By monitoring latency and throughput of the live video feed in real-time, the SLAM system can dynamically switch between edge processing and client processing. This will enable [Edge-SLAM](https://github.com/droneslab/edgeslam) to continue mapping even under suboptimal connectivity conditions, ensuring a resilient and adaptable solution for autonomous drone navigation in extreme outdoor environments.
